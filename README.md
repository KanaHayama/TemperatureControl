# About

A course project for Modern Electronics Laboratory I course in 2016 when I was a junior.
This FPGA program controls the temperature by heating the cement resistor or using a fan to blow air.

# Details

This experimental class requires students to individually complete two projects (in different categories) from a list of projects with different difficulty coefficients.
I chose the two projects with the highest coefficients of difficulty, temperature control (FPGA category) and oscilloscope text editor & display (51 MCU category).

The project requires the use of a FPGA to achieve temperature control of the temperature set by the keys on board with an accuracy of ± 1 degrees Celsius.

This project can switch between the simple control and PID control methods to achieve an accuracy of ± 0.2 degrees Celsius (This is the accuracy of temperature sensor provided by the laboratory).

This is a work before I started using Github.
I thought this project was lost due to failed to restore back up data after one laptop system reinstall.
(I lost a lot of my interesting projects o(TヘTo))
I just found it in one of my old USB stick by chance, so now I archive it using Github.
However, my report with wire connections and temperature-time oscilloscope display results was missing.
